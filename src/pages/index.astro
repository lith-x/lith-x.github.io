    <h2>About me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Inspired by a friend in middle school making websites, I began with
        HTML, then quickly moved onto learning the basics of programming with
        Python.
      </li>
      <li>
        Went on to learn Typescript and other technologies regarding web
        development (webpack, I think it was), with plugins galore to try to
        make the DevEx similar to what vite is today. Picked up other languages
        like Java through Minecraft modding.
      </li>
      <li>
        Went to university where I honed in on several skills and idioms, like
        OOP, Java, Python, Assembly, C, C++. All the way through using
        Typescript with <a href="https://tsx.is/">tsx</a> as a handy scripting language.
      </li>
      <li>
        After years of going in and out of school to work and trying to find my
        way in life, I finally graduated from <a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/"
          >UNO</a
        > with a Bachelor's in CompSci with a minor in mathematics.
      </li>
      <li>
        Recently inspired by the Youtube channel <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily">Tsoding Daily</a
        > and subsequently Casey Muratori's <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnuhp3Xd9PYTt6svyQPyRO_AAuMWGxPzU"
          >Handmade Hero</a
        >, where I found my interest in C programming with the philosophy of
        ground-up understanding, intentful design and architecture,
        performance-oriented procedural code.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now trying to get around to work on things to show off and improve on as
        a developer. :)
      </li>

        > - For my capstone, I worked with a lovely team for Northrop Grumman. We
