# Hi, I'm Aaron :)


I’m a recent graduate from the University of Nebraska Omaha, where I earned my computer science degree with a minor in mathematics. I love software, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned from my time in school and at previous jobs, it’s that I want nothing more than to have software at my fingertips that just works—and works well.

## How I Got Here

My journey with code started back in high school, when someone mentioned you could make a website with HTML. I went home, cracked open Notepad, and started typing. I’ll never forget the feeling of opening up that file in Internet Explorer and seeing my work right there on the screen (even if I thought it was already “on the web”—we all start somewhere). That moment hooked me, and coding has been my thing ever since.

I got another boost in my programming chops when I started writing a bit of C# for some osu! community projects. Since then, it’s been a long and bumpy road to that computer science degree, but I’m proud to say I made it.

## What I Love About Programming

I’ve always loved puzzles and critical thinking, and programming is where I get to really dig into both. Whether it’s solving a tricky bug or figuring out a new concept, I enjoy the challenge and the satisfaction that comes with it.

## My Tools and Inspirations

Over the years, I’ve gotten comfortable with Java, Python, and C—languages I can now pick up and use without much fuss. I was also an early adopter of TypeScript, which became my go-to for LeetCode and figuring out how to really express myself through code. When I want to keep sharp, I’ll jump into Codewars or Project Euler, especially in C, where there’s nowhere to hide from the fundamentals.

I’m a big fan of learning from folks like Tsoding and Casey Muratori, whose streams and projects have taught me a lot about the craft and joy of programming.

## What’s Next

Right now, I’m looking for a place where good software practices matter, where I can keep learning, make progress, and feel welcome on a team that supports each other—or maybe even blaze my own trail. I want to keep building, keep exploring, and keep getting better at what I love to do.
